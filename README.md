SAFE-NAV is A Safer Navigation System Based on GPS/IMU Integration with Adaptive Q-Learning

Traditional GPS-based navigation is vulnerable to outside wireless attacks and security threats such as jamming, spoofing, and GPS-to-user signal blockage.

For this purpose, we propose SAFE-NAV, a navigation toolbox that sensor fuses GPS navigation with IMU-based navigation based on Extended Kalman filter. The proposed system is accurate as GPS and also reliable as wireless-independent IMU navigation.

We also propose Q-learning for adaptive Kalman-filter parameter tuning.

This code was proposed for PickHacks2024 hackathon conducted in Missouri S&T.
